## Architecture Overview

Full-stack agile tool suite with React/TypeScript frontend and Node.js/TypeScript backend supporting real-time collaboration.

### Core Features

- **Planning Poker**: Real-time story point estimation with configurable sequences (Fibonacci, T-shirt)
- **Retrospective Boards**: Three-column retro format with card voting and timers
- **Team Velocity Tracking**: Sprint velocity visualization with Chart.js
- **Daily Standup Timer**: Configurable team member timers
- **Workspace Management**: Multi-tenant authentication with JWT and workspace invitations

## Critical Architectural Patterns

### Dependency Injection System

The backend uses a consistent DI pattern for testability:

```typescript
// All route modules export setup functions accepting dependencies
export default function setupPokerRoutes(
  pokerDb: PokerDbModule,
  workspaceDb: WorkspaceDbModule
): Router {
  // Routes use injected dependencies, never direct imports
  const rooms = await pokerDb.getRooms();
}

// Entry point injects all dependencies
app.use('/api/poker', optionalAuthenticateToken, setupPokerRoutes(pokerDb, workspaceDb));
```

### Dual-Mode Authentication

- **Anonymous Mode**: Public rooms/boards with optional passwords
- **Workspace Mode**: JWT-authenticated with role-based access (admin/member)
- Routes use `optionalAuthenticateToken` middleware to support both modes

### Socket.IO Real-time Architecture

Two typed namespaces with dependency injection:

```typescript
// Typed socket definitions in types/sockets.ts
type TypedPokerNamespace = Namespace<PokerClientToServerEvents, PokerServerToClientEvents>;

// Socket handlers receive injected dependencies
initializePokerSocket(pokerIo, pokerDb);
```

### Database Layer

- PostgreSQL with Knex migrations in `server/data/migrations/`
- DB modules in `server/db/` encapsulate all database logic
- Connection pooling via `server/db/pool.ts`
- All DB functions handle their own connections internally

## Development Patterns

### Frontend React Patterns

- **Context Providers**: `AuthContext` and `WorkspaceContext` for global state
- **Custom Hooks**: Socket management (`usePokerSocket`, `useRetroSocket`) with cleanup
- **React Query**: Token verification and API caching
- **Chakra UI**: Component library with dark/light theme support

### API Route Structure

Routes follow workspace-aware patterns:

```typescript
// Workspace header determines context
const workspaceId = req.headers['workspace-id'];
if (userId && workspaceId) {
  // Workspace mode - verify membership
  const isMember = await workspaceDb.isWorkspaceMember(workspaceId, userId);
} else {
  // Anonymous/public mode
}
```

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Jest with dependency injection mocks
- **Integration Tests**: Real database with cleanup in `beforeEach`
- **Socket Tests**: Real Socket.IO connections with proper teardown
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright with dev server integration

## Build & Development

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Frontend development
npm run dev                    # Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build                  # Production build
npm test                       # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:e2e              # Playwright E2E tests

# Backend development
cd server
npm run dev                    # TypeScript watch mode
npm run build                  # Compile TypeScript
npm test                       # Jest tests with real DB
npm run db:migrate:latest      # Run Knex migrations
```

### Environment Setup

- Frontend: Vite with TypeScript, Chakra UI, React Query
- Backend: Node.js + TypeScript with ESM modules (`.js` imports required)
- Database: PostgreSQL with connection pooling

## Code Conventions

### File Organization

```
src/
  components/           # Reusable UI components
  contexts/            # React contexts (Auth, Workspace)
  hooks/               # Custom hooks (socket management)
  pages/               # Route components
  utils/               # API utilities

server/
  routes/              # Express routes with DI setup functions
  sockets/             # Socket.IO handlers with DI
  db/                  # Database modules (users, poker, retro, etc.)
  middleware/          # Auth middleware
  types/               # TypeScript definitions
```

### TypeScript Usage

- Strict typing with interface definitions in `types/`
- ESM modules requiring `.js` extensions in imports
- Non-null assertions (`!`) used after auth middleware validation
- Socket events strictly typed with custom interfaces

### Database Patterns

- All DB functions are async and handle their own connections
- Use `executeQuery` utility for simple queries
- Proper connection release in try/finally blocks
- Knex migrations for schema changes

## Common Integration Points

### Adding New Real-time Features

1. Define socket events in `types/sockets.ts`
2. Create DB module with DI pattern
3. Implement socket handlers with injected dependencies
4. Add custom React hook for socket management
5. Update route setup in `server/index.ts`

### Workspace Integration

For features supporting both anonymous and workspace modes:

1. Add `optionalAuthenticateToken` middleware
2. Check for `workspace-id` header and `req.user`
3. Verify workspace membership when required
4. Handle both authenticated and anonymous data access

### Testing New Components

- Use dependency injection for mocking in unit tests
- Real database connections for integration tests
- Socket tests require proper connection/disconnection cleanup
- E2E tests should test both anonymous and authenticated flows

## Security Considerations

- JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- Password hashing with bcryptjs (10 rounds)
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- CORS configuration for development/production
- Workspace-based authorization for multi-tenant features
